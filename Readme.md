# Seamless
*Have a seamless experience with scene-aware Ads in streaming services!*

## Project
Seamless is an in-movie ad recommendation platform that turns streaming scenes into shoppable moments. It analyzes scenes, matches products to the right moment, and delivers non-disruptive overlays that feel native to the story.

## Flow
1. **Understand the scene and user**  
   Preprocess content to build a scene index, align transcripts with product moments, and personalize recommendations using viewer attributes.
2. **Invoke the shopping stack**  
   During playback, our MCP orchestration queries real-world inventory and selects the best matching products for the moment.
3. **Overlay and checkout**  
   Branded overlays appear directly on in-scene products, while the product surfaces in a sidebar for instant checkout or save-for-later.

## What We Built
- Scene understanding and indexing pipeline
- Product matching with real inventory lookups
- AI-powered product overlays that preserve narrative flow
- A Netflix-style frontend demo to visualize the experience
